Phonological disorders affect 10% of preschool and school-age children,
 adversely affecting their communication, academic performance, and interaction
 level.
 Effective pronunciation training requires prolonged supervised practice

\series bold
Computer-assisted pronunciation training

 has the potential for being a highly effective teaching aid; however, to-date
 such systems remain incapable of identifying pronunciation errors with

\begin_layout Itemize
Speech Intelligibility is the degree to which listeners can understand a
 speech signal's message.
 Historically, the specific acoustic sources of intelligibility are poorly
 understood, and automatic approaches to modify the degree of intelligibility
 were limited.
 We invented a hybridization approach that allows for precisely measuring
 the degree of contribution of one or more acoustic features to speech intelligi
bility.
 We applied this approach to find the most relevant acoustic features that
 cause the intelligibility improvement in clearly-spoken typical and dysarthric
 speech.
 This allows a principled study of different remedial strategies.
 We are also creating algorithms that 
\series bold
automatically improve the intelligibility of dysarthric or conversational
 speech signals
\series default
, using approaches from speech analysis, machine learning, and speech synthesis.
 These algorithms may be instrumental for next-generation hearing- and speaking-
aids.

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Sleep-disordered breathing
\series default
 is a highly prevalent condition associated with many adverse health problems.
 As the current means of diagnosis (polysomnography) is obtrusive and ill-suited
 for mass screening of the population, we explore a minimal-contact, automatic
 approach that uses acoustics-based methods in conjunction with pulse oximetry.

Text-to-Speech synthesis is the process of generating human speech artificially
 from textual input.
 Although these systems are becoming more and more commonplace, many challenges
 remain to produce natural-sounding, meaningful output.
 We have created algorithms that significantly reduce audible artifacts
 in the synthesis output, that improve the naturalness of the intonation
 contour, and that allow remarkable data compression of acoustic inventories.

Coarticulation refers to the phenomenon in which a conceptually isolated
 speech sound becomes more similar to a preceding or following speech sound.
 Modeling coarticulation in speech has been largely limited to short sequences
 and/or limited phonetic context.
 We introduce a methodology for modeling both formant frequencies and bandwidth
 in continuous speech.
 Applications of such a model include improved formant tracking, characterizatio
n of conversational vs.
 clear speech, and detection of typical vs.
 disordered speech.

 Its uses include entertainment and security applications, and, most importantly

 benefitting individuals who depend on speech-generating devices for communicati
on.
 Despite continuous research in the field, speech quality and mimic accuracy
 is still insufficient for everyday usage.

Wearable Silent Speech Technology to Enhance Impaired Oral Communication
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, PI: Jun Wang (University of Texas at Austin).
 A silent speech interface (SSI) maps articulatory movement data to speech
 output.
 Although still in experimental stages, silent speech interfaces hold significan
t potential for facilitating oral communication in persons after laryngectomy
 or with other severe voice impairments.
 Despite the recent efforts on silent speech recognition algorithm development
 using offline data analysis, online test of SSIs have rarely been conducted.
 In this paper, we present a preliminary, online test of a real-time, interactiv
e SSI based on electromagnetic motion tracking.
 The SSI played back synthesized speech sounds in response to the user’s
 tongue and lip movements.
 Three English talkers participated in this test, where they mouthed (silently
 articulated) phrases using the device to complete a phrase-reading task.
 Among the three participants, 96.67% to 100% of the mouthed phrases were
 correctly recognized and corresponding synthesized sounds were played after
 a short delay.
 Furthermore, one participant demonstrated the feasibility of using the
 SSI for a short conversation.
 The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and potential of
 silent speech interfaces based on electromagnetic articulography for future
 clinical applications.
 My role: I provide signal processing and machine-learning expertise.

Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria: Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates

Kain
\series default
 (OHSU).
 90% of the one million Americans living with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease
 (PD) and 50% of the 500,000 Americans living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
 will experience dysarthria at some point during the disease.
 The perceptual sequelae of dysarthria have devastating consequences for
 quality of life and participation in society by virtue of their effect
 on social and psychological variables such as employment, leisure activities
 and relationships.
 Knowledge of therapy techniques for maximizing perceived speech adequacy,
 as indexed by intelligibility, therefore is of paramount importance.
 As a result of our incomplete knowledge of the comparative merits of dysarthria
 therapy techniques and their variants, however, the choice of a particular
 technique is not based on a rigorous research base, but is based on either
 trial and error or the clinician’s educational and experience biases.
 The proposed project will address these barriers by comparing the acoustic
 and perceptual consequences of rate reduction, increased vocal intensity
 and clear speech variants in MS and PD.
 Our approach is to employ established acoustic measures and perceptual
 paradigms as well as a state-of-the-art speech re-synthesis technique that
 will permit conclusions concerning the underlying speech production characteris
tics, as inferred from the acoustic signal, causing improved intelligibility.

SBIR Phase 2: Prosody Assessment Toolbox
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, PI: Lindaas-Hamilton (BioSpeech).
 Abnormal receptive or expressive prosody is present in a wide range of
 disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Cognitive Impairment,
 Down’s syndrome, dysarthria, Parkinson’s disease, depression, schizophrenia,
 aphasia, Alzheimer’s disease, TBI, Language Impairment, bipolar disorder,
 ADHD, and PTSD.
 The characteristics of these prosodic abnormalities and underlying brain
 dysfunction are still largely unknown, due to the dearth of instruments
 for assessing prosodic deficits.
 Building on our broad expertise in computerized prosody assessment, we
 propose to build a system for researchers that performs automated scoring
 and acoustic analysis of expressive prosody, allows stimuli to be acoustically
 modified for detailed perceptual assessment of receptive prosody, and can
 be extended by researchers to include novel tasks.
 My role: I provide signal processing and machine-learning expertise, and
 assist with all scientific aspects of the project.

Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, PI: van Santen (OHSU).
 Since untreated language disorder can lead to serious behavioral and educationa
l problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not
 only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning
 interventions and tracking progress.
 However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional
 staff and on other scarce resources.
 As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the
 use of computer based assessment.
 Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment,
 but it has been limited to language comprehension.
 One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic
 Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring
 of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates
 in excess of 20%.
 However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can
 be used for assessment, in which a general-purpose ASR system provides
 an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would
 be scored automatically according to conventional rules.
 We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach
 that comprises two core concepts: (1) creating a special-purpose, test-specific

Development of treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders presents a formidable
 challenge.
 To advance drug discovery, assessments of laboratory rodents are widely
 employed by academia and industry to model neuropsychiatric disorders.
 Substantial recent advances in digital recordings of rodent ultrasonic
 vocalizations (USVs) have engendered interest in assessment of USVs to
 measure behavior change.

Screening for Sleep Disordered Breathing with Minimally Obtrusive Sensors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, PI: Snider (BioSpeech).
 Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is believed to be a widespread, under-diagnose
d condition associated with detrimental health problems, at a high cost
 to society.
 The current gold standard for diagnosis of SDB is a time-consuming, expensive,
 and obtrusive (requiring many attached wires) sleep study, or polysomnography
 (PSG).
 The immediate objective of our research is to develop and evaluate a hardware
 design and a set of algorithms for automatically detecting obstructive,
 central, or mixed apneas and hypopneas from acoustic, peripheral oxygen
 saturation (SpO2), and pulse rate data, using an ambient microphone and
 a wireless pulse oximeter.
 The long-term goal is to create a low-cost, easy-to-operate, minimally
 obtrusive, at-home device that can be used for early and frequent screen
 for SDB in patients' homes, significantly increasing patient comfort while
 capturing more representative sleep data compared to a clinical sleep study.
 In collaboration with Chad Hagen, M.

at the Sleep Disorders Program at OHSU, we aim to (1) develop a screening
 system by selecting minimally obtrusive sensor hardware and extending state-of-
the art algorithms for automatically detecting SDB from acoustic, SpO2,
 and pulse rate data; (2) collect patient data in the sleep lab and at home
 from representative populations using the proposed system; (3) determine
 the screening accuracy by comparing the performance of the proposed system
 on the collected data against standard PSG-derived clinical results; and
 (4) measure the usability of an at-home screening device by the target
 population, by asking subjects who participated in the at-home data collection
 to complete a survey on various aspects of the setup and operation of the
 proposed system.

 Phonemic awareness, defined as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the ability to notice, think about, and work with the individual sounds
 in spoken words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, is considered a necessary skill for literacy.
 The financial and quality-of-life costs of these impairments are significant,
 not only because of the link with reading difficulties and hence with future
 employability, but also because there may exist further links between reading
 difficulties and a range of psychiatric disorders.
 This argues for phonemic awareness intervention beyond what can be taught
 in a regular pre-school or elementary school curriculum.
 Such intervention is typically provided in the form of one-on-one sessions
 with a specialized professional (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

a Speech Language Pathologist).
 However, responding to cost concerns and poor access to these services,
 and also recognizing the importance of frequent intervention sessions,
 usage of computerized intervention systems is becoming more common.
 These computerized intervention systems have been steadily improving.
 However, one significant drawback continues to be their restricted response
 modalities, typically consisting of the child using a touch screen or a
 pointing device to select from a set of pictures.
 By confining the phonemic awareness skills that the system addresses to
 those that can be tapped into via picture-point-and-click , these systems
 have a restricted scope of what they can teach.
 A second drawback of many current systems is that their user interface
 (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

visual layout, tempo) is typically not tunable to the individual characteristics
 of the child.
 Given the prevalence of phonemic awareness issues in a broad range of neurodeve
lopmental disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder and Developmental
 Language Disorder, individual tuning may be critical to address individual
 neurocognitive weaknesses, such as problems in memory, attention, visual
 scanning, perceptual motor coordination, and processing speed.
 We have addressed these drawbacks by (1) taking advantage of drag-and-drop
 and other touch response modalities that current low-cost touch screen
 computers are capable of processing and that children are increasingly
 more familiar with, and (2) by incorporating multiple dimensions of individual
 tune-ability into the system.

 We have developed a data-driven, triphone formant trajectory model and
 methodology for estimating its parameters.
 In this model, formant targets are speaker dependent, but independent of
 speaking style.
 We have validated this model using perceptual listening tests.
 An analysis of conversationally and clearly spoken speech confirmed that
 (1) formant trajectories in clear vowels reach their targets more frequently,
 (2) formants show considerable asynchronicity, and (3) phoneme formant
 targets approximate their expected values.
 We also found preliminary evidence that targets derived from clear speech
 alone perform better at modeling both styles than targets from conversational
 speech.
 Having created and validated this model, we are now in the process of applying
 the approach to disordered speech, paving the way for an objective diagnosis
 of the degree of coarticulation of dysarthria.
 Another application is an objective evaluation of the effectiveness of
 specific speech interventions for certain kinds of dysarthria, e.

 PI: van Santen (OHSU).The expression of affect in face-to-face situations
 requires the ability to generate a complex, coordinated, cross-modal affective
 signal, having gesture, facial expression, vocal prosody, and language
 content modalities.
 This ability is compromised in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's
 disease and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
 The long term goal is to build computer-based interactive systems for remediati
on of poor affect communication and diagnosis of the underlying neurological
 disorders based on analysis of affective signals.
 A requirement for such systems is technology to detect atypical patterns
 in affective signals.
 We developed a play situation for eliciting affect and collected audio-visual
 data from approximately 60 children between the ages of 4–7 years old,
 half of them with ASD and the other half constituting a control group of
 typically developing children.
 We labeled the data on relevant affective dimensions, developed algorithms
 for the analysis of affective incongruity, and then tested the algorithms
 against the labeled data in order to determine their ability to differentiate
 between ASD and typical development.
 My role: I created special

 more speaker identity, and sounded more natural than conventional methods.
 These delexicalized speech stimuli were used in perceptual tests to exclude

 Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder due to weakness or poor co- ordination
 of the speech muscles.
 Affected muscles include the lungs, larynx, oro- and nasopharynx, soft
 palate, and articulators (lips, tongue, teeth, and jaw).
 The degree to which these muscle groups are compromised determines the
 particular pattern of speech impairment.
 For example, poor lung function affects the overall volume or loudness,
 while problems with specific articulators may cause mispronunciations of
 certain phonemes.
 There is a great variety of diseases that can cause dysarthria, including
 Parkinson’s, Multiple Sclerosis, and strokes.
 My role: I continued development of software that transforms speech compromised

 In addition, I designed a hardware configuration that allowed the software

 My role: I developed software that transforms speech compromised by dysarthria
 into easier-to-understand and more natural-sounding speech.
 The strategy for improving intelligibility is the manipulation of a small
 set of highly relevant speech features; specifically the energy, pitch,
 and formant frequencies of an input speech waveform.
 Pitch and energy are appropriately smoothed, and formant frequencies are
 mapped with a joint-density Gaussian mixture model, a technique I first
 introduced in 1998 that since has become the most often used mapping technique
 in the field.
 Results from perceptual tests indicated that the transformation improved
 intelligibility, and that the accompanying removal of the vocal fry improved
 perceived naturalness.

 Text-to-Speech Synthesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This course will introduce students to the problem of synthesizing speech
 from text input.
 Speech synthesis is a challenging area that draws on expertise from a diverse
 set of scientific fields, including signal processing, linguistics, psychology,
 statistics, and artificial intelligence.
 Fundamental advances in each of these areas will be needed to achieve truly
 human-like synthesis quality and advances in other realms of speech technology
 (like speech recognition, speech coding, speech enhancement).
 In this course, we will consider current approaches to sub-problems such
 as text analysis, pronunciation, linguistic analysis of prosody, and generation

\begin_layout Standard
This course covers a range of speech and language analysis algorithms that
 have been developed for measurement of speech or language based markers
 of neurological disorders, for the creation of assistive devices, and for
 remedial applications.
 Topics include introduction to speech and language disorders, robust speech
 signal processing, statistical approaches to pitch and timing modeling,
 voice transformation algorithms, speech segmentation, and modeling of disfluenc
y.
 The class uses a wide array of clinical data, and is closely tied to several
 ongoing research projects.
